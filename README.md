# Fuzzy-matching-Comparator
In the relay protection work of the NR Electric Group, it is an important data processing work to obtain the power stations information in the national grid. However, since the names of the power stations provided by each regional power management agencies  do not have a uniform standard at the time of naming, the information of each power station cannot be automatically integrated. Therefore, it is particularly important to ambiguously match the names of the plants in each data source (Excel format) and to treat the highly similar power station names as the same power station and thus assist the power system personnel in integrating their information. When designing this fuzzy matching algorithm, I first regarded the two power stations with the same number in the two Excel tables as the same power station, and then sorted the remaining power stations according to the name charactersâ€™ repetition rate.
